My name is **Nida Arif** and I'm a data analyst focused on solving problems in Retail, Loyalty and Marketing. Some of the work that I have done revolves around optimizing targeted marketing campaigns and mass campaigns, measuring incremental effect of promotions, pre-post campaign analysis, recommending ideal product bunndles and creating customer segments. 

Thanks to my experience in product development, I also have a knack of doing this quickly by writing re-usable macros and functions. 

In my spare time, I always try to upskill, either by taking a new course or learning a new language/technology. Oh and I also love cooking! 

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
