![Me](/img/Me.png)

My name is **Nida Arif** and I'm a data analyst focused on solving problems in Retail, Loyalty and Marketing. Some of the work that I have done revolves around optimizing targeted marketing campaigns and mass campaigns, measuring incremental effect of promotions, pre-post campaign analysis, recommending ideal product bunndles and creating customer segments. 

Thanks to my experience in product development, I also have a knack of doing this quickly by writing re-usable macros and functions. 

In my spare time, I always try to upskill, either by taking a new course or learning a new language/technology. Oh and I also love cooking! 

### my emplyment history

Currently I am working as a Senior Analyst, Customer Intelligence at Indigo Books & Music, Toronto
I have also worked at Lowe's Data Analytics and Customer Insights team and have had consulting jobs in Marketing Data Science. One of my biggest client was a global coffee and CPG company.
